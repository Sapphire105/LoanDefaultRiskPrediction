# Loan Default Risk Prediction

This was our group project for the course, Big Data and AI for Business, that we had in the second semester of the MS in Business Analytics program at University of Maryland. And as the course name suggests, our goal was to find a BIG dataset (and a problem to solve). This was when we settled on a Kaggle competition conducted by 'Home Credit', a financial institution headquartered in the Netherlands. The company operates in 10 countries and focuses on lending primarily to people with little or no credit history.

The challenge was, given a variety of alternative data of applicants, including telco and transactional information, to predict their repayment abilities.

The project had us doing -
- dataset joining
- exploratory data analysis
- feature engineering
- ML modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN)
